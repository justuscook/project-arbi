# project-arbi
Project Arbi is a discord bot for RAID: Shadow Legends using Discord.js.

The main focus is guides for champions and dungeon area, but as the game changes we try to adapt to help new to veteran player.  We have a database of over 340+ community created guides.  Fun fact, we have a "partnership" with plarium that one of the mods aranaged where we can give you 100 gems in game if you guide is added to the bots data base, and 200 if you include a video!  If interested in contributing find on discord with username Orcinus#9043 or our new discord server https://discord.gg/c5cz9P784j.

Happy Raiding!
